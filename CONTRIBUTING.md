## üìù Coding Standards

### Smart Contract Development

- Use Solidity 0.8.19 or compatible version
- Follow OpenZeppelin patterns for security
- Include comprehensive NatSpec documentation
- Write unit tests for all functions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Implement proper error handling

Example:
```solidity
/**
 * @dev Increments the counter by a specified amount
 * @param amount The amount to increment by
 * @notice Can only be called when contract is not paused
 */
function incrementBy(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
    if (_count + amount > MAX_COUNT) revert MaxCountExceeded();
    
    _count += amount;
    emit CountIncremented(_count, msg.sender);
}
```

### Frontend Development

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Write meaningful component documentation
- Use semantic HTML and accessibility features

Example:
```typescript
interface CounterDisplayProps {
  count: number;
  isLoading?: boolean;
  maxCount?: number;
  minCount?: number;
}

export const CounterDisplay: React.FC<CounterDisplayProps> = ({
  count,
  isLoading = false,
  maxCount = 1000000,
  minCount = 0,
}) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

### Documentation

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Use proper markdown formatting

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Smart Contract Tests

- Test all public functions
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Test access control mechanisms
- Verify event emissions
- Use descriptive test names

```javascript
describe("Counter Contract", function () {
  it("Should increment the counter correctly", async function () {
    await counter.increment();
    expect(await counter.getCount()).to.equal(1);
  });

  it("Should revert when incrementing beyond maximum", async function () {
    // Setup counter at max value
    await expect(counter.increment())
      .to.be.revertedWithCustomError(counter, "MaxCountExceeded");
  });
});
```

### Frontend Tests

- Test component rendering
- Test user interactions
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error states
- Use React Testing Library

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

1. **PR Title**: Use conventional commit format
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation

   - `refactor:` for code refactoring

2. **PR Description**: Include
   - What changes were made
   - Why the changes were necessary
   - How to test the changes
   - Screenshots for UI changes

3. **Review Process**
   - All PRs require at least one review
   - Address feedback promptly
   - Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
   - Ensure CI checks pass

4. **Merge Requirements**
